1. Data Loading and Preprocessing (10%)

Loaded Data: The dataset is read from 'taabi.csv' into a DataFrame.
Removed Null Columns: Columns where all values are null are dropped.
Saved Cleaned Data: The cleaned DataFrame is saved as 'output.csv'.
Removed Unnecessary Columns: Further cleaned the dataset by removing specified columns and saved it as 'taabi_final.csv'.


2. Exploratory Data Analysis (30%)
Explanation:

Data Sampling: Reduced dataset size for efficiency by selecting every 50th row.
Timestamp Conversion: Converted Unix timestamps to readable datetime format.
Feature Extraction: Added new features based on timestamp for further analysis.
Missing Values: Checked and visualized missing values.
Visualizations: Created various plots (line plots, box plots) to explore data distributions and trends.

3. Statistical Analysis (25%)

Hypothesis Testing: Performed a t-test to determine if there are significant differences between two groups.
Regression Analysis: Applied linear regression to understand the relationship between features and the target variable.

4. Insights and Recommendations (20%)

Insights: Summarized key findings from the data analysis.
Recommendations: Provided actionable suggestions based on the insights to improve operational efficiency or decision-making.

5. Code Readability and Documentation (15%)
Function Documentation: Added docstrings to functions to explain their purpose and usage.
Code Organization: Suggested modularizing code into functions for better structure and readability.
Comments: Ensured that code comments clarify the functionality and logic where needed.
